# Combining MySQL, Python, and Tableau

* I've been spending my extra time upskilling and building my programming experience. One I got a hold on MySQL and Python I figured it was time to learn how to use all three platforms together. This course teaches a mix of programming and data science techniques. 

* In this course, we also apply a machine learning to make out of sample predictions using a logit model. The purpose is to predict employee absenteeism. Variables that lack signficicance are dropped from the model. In the final model the accuracy rate is about 75%. 

* File names are listed with steps. Please run each notebook in the correct order. 
* Once you get to step 4, you will have to alter the SQL server name if you wish to download the results yourself. 

* The predictions are saved in a .csv file if you wish to double check your predictions are similar.
