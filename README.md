# Combining-SQL-Python-and-Tableau
I've been spending my extra time upskilling and building my programming experience. One I got a hold on MySQL and Python I figured it was time to learn how to use all three platforms together. 

In this course, we also apply a machine learning model to make out of sample predictions. The course teaches a mix of programming and data science techniques. 

Files are listed with steps. Please run each notebook in the correct order. 
Once you get to step 4, you will have to alter the SQL server if you wish to download the results yourself. 

The predictions are saved in a .csv file if you care to double check your predictions are similar.
